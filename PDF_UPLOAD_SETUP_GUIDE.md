# PDF Upload Setup Guide

## üö® **Issue Identified**
Your PDF upload function is failing because the **Cloudinary configuration is not properly set up**. Cloudinary is the cloud storage service that handles PDF file uploads.

## üîß **How to Fix**

### **Step 1: Get Cloudinary Account**
1. Go to [Cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. After signing up, go to your **Dashboard**

### **Step 2: Get Your Credentials**
In your Cloudinary Dashboard, you'll find:
- **Cloud Name** (e.g., `mycloud123`)
- **API Key** (e.g., `123456789012345`)
- **API Secret** (e.g., `abcdefghijklmnop`)

### **Step 3: Create Environment File**
1. In your `server` folder, create a file named `.env`
2. Add these lines (replace with your actual values):

```env
# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here

# MongoDB Configuration  
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here

# Cloudinary Configuration (REQUIRED for PDF uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### **Step 4: Restart Your Server**
After creating the `.env` file:
1. Stop your server (Ctrl+C)
2. Start it again: `npm run dev`

## üß™ **Test the Fix**

### **Test 1: Check Cloudinary Config**
Visit: `http://localhost:5000/api/pdf/test-cloudinary`
- Should show all environment variables as "Set"
- `allSet` should be `true`

### **Test 2: Upload a PDF**
1. Go to your PDF Notes page
2. Try uploading a small PDF file
3. Check the browser console for detailed logs

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### **If still getting errors:**

1. **Check Server Console:**
   - Look for "Cloudinary environment variables not configured"
   - Check if all 3 Cloudinary variables are set

2. **Verify .env File:**
   - Make sure it's in the `server` folder
   - No spaces around `=` signs
   - No quotes around values

3. **Common Issues:**
   - `.env` file in wrong location
   - Typos in variable names
   - Server not restarted after .env changes

### **Example .env file:**
```env
JWT_SECRET=mysecretkey123
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/vidyarya
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=mycloud123
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=123456789012345
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=abcdefghijklmnop
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

## üì± **Alternative Solution (If Cloudinary doesn't work)**

If you can't set up Cloudinary, I can modify the code to:
1. Store PDFs locally on your server
2. Use a different cloud service (AWS S3, Google Cloud)
3. Create a simple file storage system

## ‚úÖ **What I've Fixed**

1. **Better Error Messages** - Now shows specific upload errors
2. **Configuration Checks** - Validates Cloudinary setup before upload
3. **Detailed Logging** - Server console shows exactly what's happening
4. **Test Endpoints** - Easy way to check if everything is working

## üöÄ **After Setup**

Once Cloudinary is configured:
- PDF uploads will work instantly
- Files will be stored securely in the cloud
- You can access PDFs from anywhere
- No more upload errors!
